# Week 2 - Hands-on assignmnets

Easy wins - Target is to create very simple reporting tool

## What is the problem to solve?

Have you ever replaced a broken switch with new one in a rack full of cables and the switch somewhere in the middle? Been there, seen that but still can't help you. However, my goal is to help you a bit still. 

What if you can have a reporting tool with following features:
* Collects Switchport status information (Up or Down) before and after replacement and shows the difference?
* Collects MAC-address table of the switch before and after replacement and shows the difference?

With this utility you will very quickly see:
* if all cables are plugged in as they were before changes
* if all cables are plugged in to the switchport they were before changes
