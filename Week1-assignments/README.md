# Week 1 - Hands-on assignments
Task was to build my own lab for the course and create a Github account.

## Task 1 - Creating Github account
Github account has been created as you can see :)

## Task 2 - Building your lab
After couple of versions and troubles I ended up to following virtual lab environment:

* Windows 7 laptop with 16 GB of memory
** Vagrant Ubuntu VM created according Ivan's instructions on Virtual-box

** Virtual Lab on GNS3
*** All virtual Devices on GNS3 VM on VMware Workstation Pro
